Deep Learning Next Word Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the next 10 words from a given input. The words predicted are constrained to be from a provided paragraph.

Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model implemented using LSTM to predict the next 10 words based on a given input word. The model is trained on a specific paragraph, and it ensures that the predicted words are from this paragraph only.

Features

LSTM-based Model: Utilizes LSTM networks for sequential data prediction.
Custom Paragraph: Predictions are restricted to words from a predefined paragraph.
Easy to Use: Simply pick any word from the provided paragraph to start the prediction.
Usage
To test the model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Download the repository to your local machine.

Install dependencies:
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.

Run the model:
Open the provided script file and navigate to the end of the code where the testing section is provided.

Provide an input word:
Choose any word from the provided paragraph and run the script to see the predictions.

Example
To run a prediction, pick any word from the paragraph provided in the script. The model will predict the next 10 words based on your input.
